# Heltec_F007TH
 
 Receives Abmbient F007TH signals with RXB8
 and techem heatmeter values with sx1276
 
 F007TH_RMT.h uses the RMT of the ESP32 It does not run 100% perfect
but it is useable.
 
to be honest, this repro is public but under heavy construction
you might also call it a mess, without proper documentation yet
more a proof of concept and education exercise for me
